<p class="main1">My angel, my life, my entire world, please be with me always, my one and only girl. <br>I love you so deeply, that I know is so true, for there is no one else, my heart beats just for you.<br> No matter what happens, you're always the one, that I want to come home to, I'm the Earth to your sun.</p>

<p class="main2">My Lovely wife,

    Beauty and grace<br>
    
    A smile on my face<br>
    
    A hand to hold<br>
    
    A companion to grow old<br>
    
    A mix of laughter & shouldered tears<br>
    
    We may age, but our love does not reflect the years<br>
    
    You gave me all in life I see as good<br>
    
    Made me dream of things I never thought I could<br>
    
    My pillar of strength deep in my soul<br>
    
    The one who made my life whole<br>
    
    Indescribable beauty inside and out<br>
    
    The love you reflect casts shade on my every doubt<br>
    
    The look in your eyes can make my heart skip<br>
    
    Ever since I meet you I’ve enjoyed this trip<br>
    
    So to you my love, I thank you so<br>
    
    & I pray the end of my love you never know.</p>
